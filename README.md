# Neoliberal Podcast
This project contains the transcripts for each episode of the [Neoliberal Podcast](https://neoliberalproject.org/neoliberal-podcast).

## Format
The formetting guidelines for the transcripts are as follows:

* The file for each transcript should be in plaintext format with a .txt file extention
* The file name for each transcript should include the episode number followed by the .txt file extension. `e.g. 24.txt`
* At the beginning of each transcript, the episode number, name, published date, host(s), and attendees of the episode must be listed in that order in the top left.
    * The episode date must be formatted with the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard
* When transcribing, ensure the speaker's name is placed at the beginning of the line in square brackets, followed by a dash, then followed by the speaker's words.

For an example, see the file named `00.txt` in the root of this project.
