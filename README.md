# Neoliberal Podcast
This project contains the transcripts for each episode of the [Neoliberal Podcast](https://neoliberalproject.org/neoliberal-podcast).

## Format
The formetting guidelines for the transcripts are as follows:

* The file for each transcript should be in plaintext format with a .txt file extention
* The file name for each transcript should include the episode name followed by the .txt file extension. `e.g. Fixing the Housing Crisis ft. Jenny Schuetz.txt`
* At the beginning of each transcript, the episode name, published date, host(s), and guests of the episode must be listed in that order in the top left.
    * The episode date must be formatted with the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard
* When transcribing, ensure the speaker's name is placed at the beginning of the line in square brackets, followed by an optional timestamp, then followed by the speaker's words on a new line.
* To prevent massive horizontal scrolling of the page when reading the text, limit the length of each line to, at most, 95 characters. Do not split words to get exactly 95 characters on each line. Instead, cut the line short of or a little more than 95 characters to ensure each word is intact.

For an example, see the file named `Test Episode Name.txt` in the root of this project.
